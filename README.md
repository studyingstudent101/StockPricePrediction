# StockPricePrediction
A project for our Data 606 Capstone course. This project will use Long-Short Term Memory to predict stock prices in the future using sentiment and historical price data. You can use this code if you want to see 
some future prices of your own, if you need an example for your own project, or if you're getting started with coding and just want to see what certain lines do.
