# StockPricePrediction
A project for our Data 606 Capstone course. This project will use Long-Short Term Memory to predict stock prices in the future using sentiment and historical price data. You can use this code if you want to see 
some future prices of your own, if you need an example for your own project, or if you're getting started with coding and just want to see what certain lines do. Attached to the secondary headings are links to the folders associated with each phase.

## [Phase One](https://github.com/studyingstudent101/StockPricePrediction/tree/main/week01P1)
Phase one had the main idea down, though it still needed much work done as everything does in the beginning.

## [Phase Two](https://github.com/studyingstudent101/StockPricePrediction/tree/main/phase2)
A substantial improvement from the first phase, the team believed we were essentially finished at this point. The professor had some suggestions to improve our project, pointing out that some questions went unanswered. This phase had a heavy emphasis on EDA.

## [Phase Three](https://github.com/studyingstudent101/StockPricePrediction/tree/main/PhaseThree)
The final phase is where we finished our work, including recommendations from the previous phase. Mainly, the finalized code, as well as the project report.
